# web_dev_playground
A personal space to explore, experiment, and learn core concepts of web development — from HTML &amp; CSS to JavaScript, React, APIs, and beyond.

##  Purpose

This repo is not a single project — it's a space to:

- Try out new web development concepts
- Practice building responsive and interactive UIs
- Document my progress and growth
- Keep a version-controlled archive of small experiments
